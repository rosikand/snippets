# ðŸ”Œ Snippets
Toolbox of short, reusable pieces of code and knowledge. The motivation for constructing this site is so that I can quickly retrieve snippets of code that I use/refer to often. 

The site is powered by Jekyll and Github Pages using the [minimal theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal).
